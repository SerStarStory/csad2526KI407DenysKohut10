Write a simple cpp "Hello World" program.

Here's a simple C++ "Hello World" program:``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This program:
Includes the iostream library for input/output operations
Defines the main() function, which is the entry point of every C++ program
Uses std::cout to print "Hello World" to the console
Uses std::endl to add a newline and flush the output buffer
Returns 0 to indicate successful program execution
